# bible

A free, open source, web-based tool for reading/searching the Bible.

## Development

Download the source. Install python3 and nodejs. Then, in the source dir:

`npm run build`

and either:

`npm run serve`

or

`npm run serve-dev`

The latter will use the sources in src/app, so refreshes will pick up any new changes there.
Either way, you can then load the app at http://localhost:8000/bible.html
