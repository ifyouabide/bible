# bible

A free, fast, minimalist, and open source web-based tool for reading/searching the Bible.

## Development

Download the source. Install nodejs (v14.5+) and node's npm package manager. Then, in the source dir:

`npm install`

`npm run build`

`npm run serve`

Then load the app at http://localhost:8000

Note, the build step takes awhile (few minutes) because of Brotli compression.
