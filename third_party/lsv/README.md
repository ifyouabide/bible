## About/License

*From the publisher ([link](https://www.lsvbible.com/p/get-lsv.html)):*

The first edition of the Literal Standard Version went live on February 2, 2020 and since then the LSV team has been seeking to make this groundbreaking translation available to more readers in more and various formats at as low a cost as possible, because God's word should be delivered without profit motive to those from every walk of life. “Freely you received, freely give.” The LSV will always be offered for free in digital format, but some formats have production and delivery costs and you can help support our ministry when you purchase the LSV in one of these formats.
