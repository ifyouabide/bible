# Third party

This directory contains raw (or nearly raw) third party resources that are publicly available
and permissively licensed.

https://hackathon.bible/data/ has a lot of good pointers.

## Excluded Resources

Some considered, but non-qualifying resources include:

### SBLGNT

From their license:

"The SBLGNT may not be used in a Greek-English diglot without a license, regardless of whether such work will be sold or given away.
Diglots containing the SBLGNT and a language other than English may be produced for free distribution."

### Lexham English Bible Englishâ€“Greek Reverse Interlinear New Testament

"Textual alignment, Greek Morphology, Lemmatization and Strongs number assignment Copyright 2010
Logos Bible Software"

The Greek in this is simply the SBLGNT, which prohibits use with English as noted above.

### NET Bible

Use of the English is permitted, but their mapping to the original languages/Strongs may not be;
I couldn't find any explicit information about this. Given that their translation notes are
copyrighted, and that they don't publish the mapping anywhere on their website, it is likely
restricted.
